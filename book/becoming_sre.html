<p>Site <strong>Reliability</strong> Engineering is an engineering discipline devoted to
helpings orgs <strong>sustainably</strong> achieve the <strong>appropriate</strong> level of
reliability in their systems, services and products.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>3 key words from definition</p>
<ul>
<li>Reliability: even  if you have the best software in the world, and the best
sales team, if the sw is not up when customers need it, you lose a lot of:
<ul>
<li>Revenue</li>
<li>Time</li>
<li>Reputation</li>
<li>Health</li>
<li>Hiring</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Appropriate
<ul>
<li>Usually 100% reliable is not achievable, it is likely that your
dependencies are not 100% reliable.</li>
<li>You need to use <em><strong>service level indicators/service level objectives</strong></em>
(SLI/SLO) to help determine an appropriate level of reliability.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Sustainable
<ul>
<li>If the people in the org are burned out they wont be able to build
reliable systems.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="sre-vs-devops"><a class="header" href="#sre-vs-devops">SRE vs Devops</a></h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>SRE implements class devops</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>SRE is to reliability as devops is to delivery</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It‚Äôs all about the direction</p>
<p><img src="img/sre-vs-devops.png" alt="sre-vs-devops.png" /> <em><a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/becoming-sre/9781492090540/">Source: Becoming SRE
O'Reilly</a></em></p>
</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Devops go from development to production operations</li>
<li>SRE seems to start on prod operations, and going back to improve the result.</li>
</ul>
<p>Basically these two phrases:</p>
<ul>
<li>Devops thinks, how can I deploy this from my laptop to production</li>
<li>SRE starts at production, how can I make the environment more reliable.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="sre-mindset"><a class="header" href="#sre-mindset">SRE Mindset</a></h2>
<p>It is born out of curiosity: <em>How does a system work? How does it fail?</em></p>
<p>Zoom out and Zoom in as much as possible, how does the‚Ä¶ work</p>
<ul>
<li>The whole app, development and deployment process</li>
<li>The entire service</li>
<li>The infrastructure</li>
<li>The physical overlay of the infra</li>
<li>The sociotechnical  context in which the infra runs</li>
<li>The org context where the sociotechnical context resides in</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="keeping-focus-on-the-customer"><a class="header" href="#keeping-focus-on-the-customer">Keeping Focus on the Customer</a></h3>
<p>Small example, say you have a 100 servers running a front end pool, suddenly 14
systems fail and are not recovering.  This situation is:</p>
<ol>
<li>No big deal; you can deal with it at your leisure</li>
<li>Something that warrants your immediate attentions. Stop what you are doing
and focus on this</li>
<li>Crisis, even if 2 AM go wake the CEO</li>
</ol>
<p>The answer, <em>it depends</em>, you need to ask, how does this affect the system as a
whole. If the customers wont see anything diff then <strong>a.</strong> If visible by
customers then <strong>b</strong>. If the service is dead in the water and this means no
revenue, go wake the CEO.</p>
<p>So basically you need to ask: <em>What is the intention of the system from the
customer‚Äôs perspective?</em></p>
<h3 id="sres-relationship-with-failure"><a class="header" href="#sres-relationship-with-failure">SRE‚Äôs Relationship with Failure</a></h3>
<p>SRE are very collaborative. Reliability is a collaborative endeavour by nature.</p>
<p>The SRE mindset views errors as an opportunity to learn. Learning from failure
is a core component of an SRE.</p>
<p>SRE treats errors as a signal and we like clear signals. With an SRE mindset
errors can serve the helping understand the system better. This means we need
to surface the errors in addition to eliminate them.</p>
<p>SRE feels ownership of the whole service, t<strong>hey do not say often ‚Äúnot my code,
not my problem‚Äù.</strong> This can be un <em>arma de doble filo.</em> Because of the <strong>yak
shaving issue,</strong> where you go to do one task, say update a package, but then
you check and for the new package you need to upgrade the OS, but to upgrade
the OS you need to‚Ä¶ and you end up with a trimmer in your hands and a yak
infront of you. Taking ownership of the whole range of services and so on, can
lead to this. **</p>
<h3 id="the-mindset-in-motion"><a class="header" href="#the-mindset-in-motion">The Mindset in Motion</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>How does a system work? ‚Üí How will the system work if we scale it?</li>
<li>How does a system work? ‚Üí How can the system work with less operational load
<ul>
<li>SREs are angered by <strong>toil</strong> and the almost allergic reaction it provokes
in them.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>How does a system work? ‚Üí How can the system work reliable for more people</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="culture"><a class="header" href="#culture">Culture</a></h2>
<p>Support an enviorment where SREs can thrive.</p>
<ul>
<li>Celebrate the elimination of toil, give SREs opportunity to look for toil and
come up with ideas on how to remove it.</li>
<li>Support curosity</li>
</ul>
<p>Other good way is to support the creation of documentation ‚Äúit is not finished
until it is documented‚Äù</p>
<h3 id="new-hires"><a class="header" href="#new-hires">New hires</a></h3>
<p>For new hires good some good tasks are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Find something unclear, missing or in some way needing improvment on the docs
and fix it.
<ul>
<li>This has the benefit that they need to interact with the docs and read
it, at a deep enough level that they can improve it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Taking our inline database of all systems on our network, and make sure it
was correct by visiting the locations</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="avoid"><a class="header" href="#avoid">Avoid</a></h3>
<p>How to avoid the incident-handling train of the SRE will always fix everything.</p>
<p>A good question to anwser is ‚ÄúWho is getting smarter and what are we doing
about it?‚Äù The ideal would be that you are getting good new info about your
systems and how they fail.</p>
<p>But if just the SREs are the ones that are learning, you are in reverse, you
are going the opposite direction of culture you are hoping to create.</p>
<p>If the answer is close to: SREs, engineering personnel and relevant stake
holders, you can go to the next question, What is the rest of the org doing
with this knowledge?.</p>
<h3 id="cool-ideas-to-improve-culture"><a class="header" href="#cool-ideas-to-improve-culture"><strong>Cool Ideas to improve culture</strong></a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Start a <strong>postmortem group</strong>,

<p>You already have a good well-exercised skill for troubleshooting and debugging.</p>
<p>Do exercises in SadServers, like leet code but for infrastructure.</p>
<p>Change you mindset from ‚Äúmonitor all the things‚Äù to ‚Äúmeasure reliability from
the customer perspective, not the component perspective‚Äù</p>
<p>Using terms like ‚Äúcontributing factors‚Äù instead of ‚Äúroot cause‚Äù can change both
your internal and external way of looking at an issue. More on this on chapter
10.</p>
<p>Since you are already answering tickets, getting emails on things failing, you
can start using that as a data set to start measure the reliability of the
systems and how/why they fail.</p>

<h3 id="what-to-ask-at-the-sre-interview"><a class="header" href="#what-to-ask-at-the-sre-interview">What to ask at the SRE Interview</a></h3>
<p>Some good conversation starters:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Tell me about your monitoring system</strong></p>
<p>This exposes all sort of info on organization, structure, collaboration,
ownership, How decision are made, and so on.</p>
<p>Some follow up questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Who owns monitoring in your org?</li>
<li>How many monitoring systems are there in active use?</li>
<li>Who (apps/services/teams) send data to those systems, and who access
them?</li>
<li>How easy it is to onboard a new app/service to your monitoring?</li>
<li>What decisions are made using the data?</li>
<li>Are there alerts generated fromt his system?</li>
<li>What makes you happy and unhappy with your current system?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Tell me about your post-incidents review process</strong></p>
<p>Here you are trying to see how intentional are they on learning from
failure</p>
<ul>
<li>Do you hold post-incidents review after your outages?</li>
<li>What is their purpose?</li>
<li>Who is ‚Äúin the room‚Äù for them?</li>
<li>How do you document your outages?</li>
<li>Can you tell me (at whatever level of details you are comfortable) about
a recent outage</li>
<li>Do you have a sense of the most common classes of outage you have seen in
the last N month? (config related, overload/resource-deprivation
failures, code bug)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Tell me about you on-call setup</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Do people get time off after incidents?</li>
<li>Who in the org participates in an on-call rotation (just SREs? Devs?
Managers?)</li>
<li>When was the last time you personally were ‚Äúpaged‚Äù?</li>
<li>Do people get paged equally often between work and off-work hours?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>What problem does SRE exist to address in your org?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>If they cannot answer that: What are some ‚Äòrecent wins‚Äô by SRE in the
past 6 to 12 months?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Can SREs check in code to major repos in your org?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>You‚Äôll see how involved is the SRE with dev work</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="a-day-in-the-life-of-an-sre"><a class="header" href="#a-day-in-the-life-of-an-sre">A Day in the Life of an SRE</a></h2>
<p>Because of the nature of the SRE role, it is hard to describe an average day,
since it most days are different to each other. So instead of an average day,
we have different modes SREs can relate to. Look at it like different hats an
SRE will wear</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Incident/Outage Mode</strong></p>
<p>There will be days were most of your time you will be involved dealing with
an accident. These days come with some feelings attached to them (fear,
anxiety, and so on), the intensity of these feelings depend on the severity
of the outage.</p>
<p>When on this mode you will be reacting not planning it is normal.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Post-incident Learning Mode</strong></p>
<p>After the incident now you have the opportunity to review the memories of
an outage and learn from it.</p>
<p>You are responsible for documenting it, in a way others can understand it.
To do this you will have to investigate a bit, look for data in your
monitoring systems, talk to your colleagues to discover what they knew and
when.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Builder/Project/Learn Mode</strong></p>
<p>This is when you actually have time to sit and...</p>
<ul>
<li>Devlop some code for services or SRE tasks</li>
<li>Provision new envs or infra</li>
<li>Improve monitoring/observability</li>
<li>Removing toil</li>
<li>Writing docs</li>
<li>Learning a new tech in anticipation of using it some day</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, there will be times when you are doing boring stuff, but that
can help you identify toil you need to remove.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Architecture Mode</strong></p>
<p>Depends on your org, but, and SRE should be showing up to design and
planning meetings where they are acting as a representative  for
reliability.</p>
<p>Be political about it, no one wants to hear, "<em>this would have never happen
if there was an SRE when this thing was designed</em>". Appeal to the sense
that everyone want to have their code in production be as reliable as
possible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Management Mode</strong></p>
<p>If the response to, <em>what did you do all day?</em>, was, <em>I went to meetings</em>,
do not worry, chances are you might be an SRE manager.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Planning Mode</strong></p>
<p>Some portion of your day will be planning.</p>
<ul>
<li>Implementation plans</li>
<li>Capacity planning</li>
<li>Self-definitional work (goals of SRE team and stuff like that)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Collaboration Mode</strong></p>
<p><mark> The SRE role is relentlessly collaborative.</mark></p>
<p>When you implement SLI/SLO (Service Level Indicators/Service Level
Objectives) you will be working with: devs, PMs, stakeholders.</p>
<p>Another example of collaborative work, is what some people call pre-launch
review. An SRE gets involved to revise the service being deployed in
production, what is necessary for it to run reliably in production</p>
<p>Do not be a gatekeeper, share this work with the devs and the stakeholders,
collaborate as much as possible</p>
<p>Finally, listen to the customers through monitoring work. The SLIs/SLOs
(Service Level Indicators, Service Level Objectives) are meant to provide
ongoing collaboration with the customer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Recovery and Self-Care Mode</strong></p>
<p>Burn out SREs are of no good to anyone. Because of the nature of SREs it
can be easy to overextending yourself. But when we hear that someone is
regularly working 60-75 hours, is not something to be proud of, that means
there is a failure in the system and needs to be fixed.</p>
<p>You need to have recovery time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>On Balance</strong></p>
<p>Balance is something good to strive for, but there are often situational
factors  that complicate the effort, for example, an <em>early service</em> vs <em>mature
service</em>, new services are always noisier and require more reactive work. They
also provide more toil to be stripped away, so maybe you expend more time in
one of these modes than in others.</p>
<p>The idea is to see this as weather patterns, I know it is going to rain hard
for some time, but I mentally prepare. Ideally things will level out. If not,
you need to strive for it. SRE attempts to be a <strong>sustainable</strong> operations
practice. If you realise this cannot be sustained maybe you need to start
looking for a different job.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="establishing-a-relationship-to-toil"><a class="header" href="#establishing-a-relationship-to-toil">Establishing a Relationship to Toil</a></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>If a human operator needs to touch  your system during normal operations, you
have a bug. The definition of normal changes are your systems grow.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Carla Geisser, Google SRE</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="what-is-toil"><a class="header" href="#what-is-toil">What is toil?</a></h3>
<p>First of all we need to define toil. Toil is not the work you do not like to do
or simply repetitive chores. Toil is the kind of work when running a production
service, that to tends to be:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Manual
Work like manually running a script that automates a task is still manual,
the time that a human spends running the script is still toil time</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Repetitive
Toil is work you do over and over.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Automatable
If human judgment is essential for the task, there is a good chance it is
not toil.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tactical
Toil is reactive rather than strategy-driven.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Does not bring enduring value
If your service is in the same state after you finished a task, the task
was probably toil.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>O(n) with service growth
If the work  involved scales linearly with the size of the service (traffic
volume, service size) is it probably toil.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We need to have less toil because it tends to expand, if left unchecked  it can
quickly fill 100% of everyone's time, and people will stop doing <em>Engineering
Work</em>. What is that? Engineering work is novel and requires human judgment. It
produces permanent improvement in your service and is guided by strategy.</p>
<p>Now that we know what toil is, lets see the relationship SREs have to it.</p>
<h3 id="whose-toil-are-we-talking-about"><a class="header" href="#whose-toil-are-we-talking-about">Whose Toil Are We Talking About?</a></h3>
<p><em>Whose toil is it?</em> On opposed to other parts of SRE where we are customer
focuses, here we need to focus on our toil, not the customers one. Sure, they
might have a connection for example, operational toil (ours) is exposed to the
customer if they have to go into 4 steps to make a request. But we need to keep
the main focus on the operational toil.</p>
<h3 id="why-do-sres-care-about-toil"><a class="header" href="#why-do-sres-care-about-toil">Why do SREs Care about toil?</a></h3>
<p>An argument can be made that if you remove toil a system becomes more reliable,
but the author suggests that sometimes this is not the case. An that SREs
because of their nature, are inclined to  eliminate toil because of the
following reasons.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Aesthetics
SREs want to eliminate toil because if offends their aesthetic
sensibilities. Toil is inelegant, inefficient, unnecessary, suboptimal,
hard to look at. That simply is a reason to remove it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Money
Orgs have many reasons to want their expensive people do work that is
significant  that make the revenue forward, meaning the antithesis of toil.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Job Satisfaction</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="early-vs-established-toil"><a class="header" href="#early-vs-established-toil">Early vs Established Toil</a></h3>
<p>When an app is developed it is likely to have more toil than once it is
established. Why? Developers care about making a solution to a customer
problem, not making their app be super operational. They can be, and that is
why it is important that an SRE is in the room when planning the Architecture
for the app, but it is likely that it will have more toil than an established
one.</p>
<p>It is important to note this, because now we can mentally prepare for it, we
now know that there will be a finite period of work with a lot of toil, but it
is expected and it will end.</p>
<h3 id="dealing-with-toil"><a class="header" href="#dealing-with-toil">Dealing with Toil</a></h3>
<p>Usually people just say, automate it, and the toil will go away. But the author
propose the idea that similar to matter that toil is not created and cannot be
destroyed just transformed.</p>
<p>When you are automating a task, the toil did not disappeared it just got
transformed into a different thing: <em>Complexity</em>. Usually this is a wise
bargain to take, but it is important to keep in mind that it has its  trade
offs.</p>
<h4 id="intermediate-to-advanced-toil-reduction"><a class="header" href="#intermediate-to-advanced-toil-reduction">Intermediate to Advanced Toil Reduction</a></h4>
<p>It is important to keep track of the toil we remove on individual systems,
management will love to hear that X system required N manual steps and now it
was automated and require N-4 steps. But once you pass that first stage you
also need to start thinking. How can I reduce the toil we are going to have?</p>
<h3 id="go-remove-the-toil"><a class="header" href="#go-remove-the-toil">Go Remove the Toil</a></h3>
<p>That is pretty much it for this chapter, we defined what toil is and how to
deal with it. Go and put in practice what you have read here.</p>
