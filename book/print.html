<blockquote>
<p>Site <strong>Reliability</strong> Engineering is an engineering discipline devoted to
helpings orgs <strong>sustainably</strong> achieve the <strong>appropriate</strong> level of
reliability in their systems, services and products.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>3 key words from definition</p>
<ul>
<li>Reliability: even  if you have the best software in the world, and the best
sales team, if the sw is not up when customers need it, you lose a lot of:
<ul>
<li>Revenue</li>
<li>Time</li>
<li>Reputation</li>
<li>Health</li>
<li>Hiring</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Appropriate
<ul>
<li>Usually 100% reliable is not achievable, it is likely that your
dependencies are not 100% reliable.</li>
<li>You need to use <em><strong>service level indicators/service level objectives</strong></em>
(SLI/SLO) to help determine an appropriate level of reliability.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Sustainable
<ul>
<li>If the people in the org are burned out they wont be able to build
reliable systems.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="sre-vs-devops"><a class="header" href="#sre-vs-devops">SRE vs Devops</a></h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>SRE implements class devops</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>SRE is to reliability as devops is to delivery</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It‚Äôs all about the direction</p>
<p><img src="img/sre-vs-devops.png" alt="sre-vs-devops.png" /> <em><a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/becoming-sre/9781492090540/">Source: Becoming SRE
O'Reilly</a></em></p>
</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Devops go from development to production operations</li>
<li>SRE seems to start on prod operations, and going back to improve the result.</li>
</ul>
<p>Basically these two phrases:</p>
<ul>
<li>Devops thinks, how can I deploy this from my laptop to production</li>
<li>SRE starts at production, how can I make the environment more reliable.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="sre-mindset"><a class="header" href="#sre-mindset">SRE Mindset</a></h2>
<p>It is born out of curiosity: <em>How does a system work? How does it fail?</em></p>
<p>Zoom out and Zoom in as much as possible, how does the‚Ä¶ work</p>
<ul>
<li>The whole app, development and deployment process</li>
<li>The entire service</li>
<li>The infrastructure</li>
<li>The physical overlay of the infra</li>
<li>The sociotechnical  context in which the infra runs</li>
<li>The org context where the sociotechnical context resides in</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="keeping-focus-on-the-customer"><a class="header" href="#keeping-focus-on-the-customer">Keeping Focus on the Customer</a></h3>
<p>Small example, say you have a 100 servers running a front end pool, suddenly 14
systems fail and are not recovering.  This situation is:</p>
<ol>
<li>No big deal; you can deal with it at your leisure</li>
<li>Something that warrants your immediate attentions. Stop what you are doing
and focus on this</li>
<li>Crisis, even if 2 AM go wake the CEO</li>
</ol>
<p>The answer, <em>it depends</em>, you need to ask, how does this affect the system as a
whole. If the customers wont see anything diff then <strong>a.</strong> If visible by
customers then <strong>b</strong>. If the service is dead in the water and this means no
revenue, go wake the CEO.</p>
<p>So basically you need to ask: <em>What is the intention of the system from the
customer‚Äôs perspective?</em></p>
<h3 id="sres-relationship-with-failure"><a class="header" href="#sres-relationship-with-failure">SRE‚Äôs Relationship with Failure</a></h3>
<p>SRE are very collaborative. Reliability is a collaborative endeavour by nature.</p>
<p>The SRE mindset views errors as an opportunity to learn. Learning from failure
is a core component of an SRE.</p>
<p>SRE treats errors as a signal and we like clear signals. With an SRE mindset
errors can serve the helping understand the system better. This means we need
to surface the errors in addition to eliminate them.</p>
<p>SRE feels ownership of the whole service, t<strong>hey do not say often ‚Äúnot my code,
not my problem‚Äù.</strong> This can be un <em>arma de doble filo.</em> Because of the <strong>yak
shaving issue,</strong> where you go to do one task, say update a package, but then
you check and for the new package you need to upgrade the OS, but to upgrade
the OS you need to‚Ä¶ and you end up with a trimmer in your hands and a yak
infront of you. Taking ownership of the whole range of services and so on, can
lead to this. **</p>
<h3 id="the-mindset-in-motion"><a class="header" href="#the-mindset-in-motion">The Mindset in Motion</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>How does a system work? ‚Üí How will the system work if we scale it?</li>
<li>How does a system work? ‚Üí How can the system work with less operational load
<ul>
<li>SREs are angered by <strong>toil</strong> and the almost allergic reaction it provokes
in them.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>How does a system work? ‚Üí How can the system work reliable for more people</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="culture"><a class="header" href="#culture">Culture</a></h2>
<p>Support an enviorment where SREs can thrive.</p>
<ul>
<li>Celebrate the elimination of toil, give SREs opportunity to look for toil and
come up with ideas on how to remove it.</li>
<li>Support curosity</li>
</ul>
<p>Other good way is to support the creation of documentation ‚Äúit is not finished
until it is documented‚Äù</p>
<h3 id="new-hires"><a class="header" href="#new-hires">New hires</a></h3>
<p>For new hires good some good tasks are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Find something unclear, missing or in some way needing improvment on the docs
and fix it.
<ul>
<li>This has the benefit that they need to interact with the docs and read
it, at a deep enough level that they can improve it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Taking our inline database of all systems on our network, and make sure it
was correct by visiting the locations</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="avoid"><a class="header" href="#avoid">Avoid</a></h3>
<p>How to avoid the incident-handling train of the SRE will always fix everything.</p>
<p>A good question to anwser is ‚ÄúWho is getting smarter and what are we doing
about it?‚Äù The ideal would be that you are getting good new info about your
systems and how they fail.</p>
<p>But if just the SREs are the ones that are learning, you are in reverse, you
are going the opposite direction of culture you are hoping to create.</p>
<p>If the answer is close to: SREs, engineering personnel and relevant stake
holders, you can go to the next question, What is the rest of the org doing
with this knowledge?.</p>
<h3 id="cool-ideas-to-improve-culture"><a class="header" href="#cool-ideas-to-improve-culture"><strong>Cool Ideas to improve culture</strong></a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Start a <strong>postmortem group</strong>,
<ul>
<li>Where someone does a writeup of an issue/outage that happened. Give it in
advance before the meeting, and discuss what could have been done diff,
or proposal on the arch, stuff like that.
<ul>
<li>Good first questions are:
<ul>
<li>What is missing from the write-up we have here?</li>
<li>What do we still not  know, or what may we never know?</li>
<li>Why wasn‚Äôt this worse?</li>
</ul>

<p>You already have a good well-exercised skill for troubleshooting and debugging.</p>
<p>Do exercises in SadServers, like leet code but for infrastructure.</p>
<p>Change you mindset from ‚Äúmonitor all the things‚Äù to ‚Äúmeasure reliability from
the customer perspective, not the component perspective‚Äù</p>
<p>Using terms like ‚Äúcontributing factors‚Äù instead of ‚Äúroot cause‚Äù can change both
your internal and external way of looking at an issue. More on this on chapter

<h3 id="what-to-ask-at-the-sre-interview"><a class="header" href="#what-to-ask-at-the-sre-interview">What to ask at the SRE Interview</a></h3>
<p>Some good conversation starters:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Tell me about your monitoring system</strong></p>
<p>This exposes all sort of info on organization, structure, collaboration,
ownership, How decision are made, and so on.</p>
<p>Some follow up questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Who owns monitoring in your org?</li>
<li>How many monitoring systems are there in active use?</li>
<li>Who (apps/services/teams) send data to those systems, and who access
them?</li>
<li>How easy it is to onboard a new app/service to your monitoring?</li>
<li>What decisions are made using the data?</li>
<li>Are there alerts generated fromt his system?</li>
<li>What makes you happy and unhappy with your current system?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Tell me about your post-incidents review process</strong></p>
<p>Here you are trying to see how intentional are they on learning from
failure</p>
<ul>
<li>Do you hold post-incidents review after your outages?</li>
<li>What is their purpose?</li>
<li>Who is ‚Äúin the room‚Äù for them?</li>
<li>How do you document your outages?</li>
<li>Can you tell me (at whatever level of details you are comfortable) about
a recent outage</li>
<li>Do you have a sense of the most common classes of outage you have seen in
the last N month? (config related, overload/resource-deprivation
failures, code bug)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Tell me about you on-call setup</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Do people get time off after incidents?</li>
<li>Who in the org participates in an on-call rotation (just SREs? Devs?
Managers?)</li>
<li>When was the last time you personally were ‚Äúpaged‚Äù?</li>
<li>Do people get paged equally often between work and off-work hours?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>What problem does SRE exist to address in your org?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>If they cannot answer that: What are some ‚Äòrecent wins‚Äô by SRE in the
past 6 to 12 months?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Can SREs check in code to major repos in your org?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>You‚Äôll see how involved is the SRE with dev work</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="a-day-in-the-life-of-an-sre"><a class="header" href="#a-day-in-the-life-of-an-sre">A Day in the Life of an SRE</a></h2>
<p>Because of the nature of the SRE role, it is hard to describe an average day,
since it most days are different to each other. So instead of an average day,
we have different modes SREs can relate to. Look at it like different hats an
SRE will wear</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Incident/Outage Mode</strong></p>
<p>There will be days were most of your time you will be involved dealing with
an accident. These days come with some feelings attached to them (fear,
anxiety, and so on), the intensity of these feelings depend on the severity
of the outage.</p>
<p>When on this mode you will be reacting not planning it is normal.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Post-incident Learning Mode</strong></p>
<p>After the incident now you have the opportunity to review the memories of
an outage and learn from it.</p>
<p>You are responsible for documenting it, in a way others can understand it.
To do this you will have to investigate a bit, look for data in your
monitoring systems, talk to your colleagues to discover what they knew and
when.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Builder/Project/Learn Mode</strong></p>
<p>This is when you actually have time to sit and...</p>
<ul>
<li>Devlop some code for services or SRE tasks</li>
<li>Provision new envs or infra</li>
<li>Improve monitoring/observability</li>
<li>Removing toil</li>
<li>Writing docs</li>
<li>Learning a new tech in anticipation of using it some day</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, there will be times when you are doing boring stuff, but that
can help you identify toil you need to remove.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Architecture Mode</strong></p>
<p>Depends on your org, but, and SRE should be showing up to design and
planning meetings where they are acting as a representative  for
reliability.</p>
<p>Be political about it, no one wants to hear, "<em>this would have never happen
if there was an SRE when this thing was designed</em>". Appeal to the sense
that everyone want to have their code in production be as reliable as
possible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Management Mode</strong></p>
<p>If the response to, <em>what did you do all day?</em>, was, <em>I went to meetings</em>,
do not worry, chances are you might be an SRE manager.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Planning Mode</strong></p>
<p>Some portion of your day will be planning.</p>
<ul>
<li>Implementation plans</li>
<li>Capacity planning</li>
<li>Self-definitional work (goals of SRE team and stuff like that)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Collaboration Mode</strong></p>
<p><mark> The SRE role is relentlessly collaborative.</mark></p>
<p>When you implement SLI/SLO (Service Level Indicators/Service Level
Objectives) you will be working with: devs, PMs, stakeholders.</p>
<p>Another example of collaborative work, is what some people call pre-launch
review. An SRE gets involved to revise the service being deployed in
production, what is necessary for it to run reliably in production</p>
<p>Do not be a gatekeeper, share this work with the devs and the stakeholders,
collaborate as much as possible</p>
<p>Finally, listen to the customers through monitoring work. The SLIs/SLOs
(Service Level Indicators, Service Level Objectives) are meant to provide
ongoing collaboration with the customer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Recovery and Self-Care Mode</strong></p>
<p>Burn out SREs are of no good to anyone. Because of the nature of SREs it
can be easy to overextending yourself. But when we hear that someone is
regularly working 60-75 hours, is not something to be proud of, that means
there is a failure in the system and needs to be fixed.</p>
<p>You need to have recovery time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>On Balance</strong></p>
<p>Balance is something good to strive for, but there are often situational
factors  that complicate the effort, for example, an <em>early service</em> vs <em>mature
service</em>, new services are always noisier and require more reactive work. They
also provide more toil to be stripped away, so maybe you expend more time in
one of these modes than in others.</p>
<p>The idea is to see this as weather patterns, I know it is going to rain hard
for some time, but I mentally prepare. Ideally things will level out. If not,
you need to strive for it. SRE attempts to be a <strong>sustainable</strong> operations
practice. If you realise this cannot be sustained maybe you need to start
looking for a different job.</p>

<aside>
üí° K8s is an open source orchestrator for deploying containerized applications
</aside>
<p>It has become the standard API for building cloud native applications. It
provides the software needed for build and deploy, reliable, scalable
distributed systems.</p>
<p><strong>Distributed systems:</strong> Most services nowadays are delivered via the network,
they have different moving parts in different machines talking to each other
over the network via APIs.</p>
<p><strong>Reliable:</strong> Since we rely a lot on these distributed systems, they cannot
fail, even if some part of them crashes, they need to be kept up and running,
and be fault-tolerant</p>
<p><strong>Availability:</strong> They must still be available during maintenance, updates,
software rollouts and so on.</p>
<p><strong>Scalable:</strong> We live in a highly connected society, so these systems need to
be able to grow their capacity without radical redesign of the distributed
systems.</p>
<p>Most of the reasons people come to use containers and container orchestration
like k8s, can be boil down to 5 things:  <strong>velocity, scaling, abstracting your
infra, efficiency, cloud native ecosystem</strong></p>
<h2 id="development-velocity"><a class="header" href="#development-velocity">Development Velocity</a></h2>
<p>Today software is delivered via de network more quickly than ever, but velocity
is not just a matter of raw speed, people are more interested in a highly
reliable service, all users expect constant uptime, even as the software is
being updated.</p>
<p>Velocity is measures in term of the number of things you can ship while
maintaining a highly available service.</p>
<p>k8s give you the tools to to do this, the core concepts to enable this are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Immutability</strong></p>
<p>Software used to be mutable (imperative), you installed <code>vim</code> using <code>dnf</code>
and then one day you would do <code>dnf update</code>  and it would add modifications
on top of the binary that you already have for <code>vim</code>. This is what we call
<em>mutable</em> software.</p>
<p>On the other hand, <em>immutable</em> software, you would not add on top of the
previous release, you would build the image from zero. Which is how
containers work. Basically when you want to update something in a
container, you do not go inside it and do <code>dnf update vim</code> you create a new
image with the version of vim you want, destroy the old one, and create a
container with the new one.</p>
<p>This makes rollbacks way easier, and it keeps tracks of what changed from
version to version.</p>
  <aside>
  üí° Imperatively change running containers (going into the container and
  update a package for example) is an anti-pattern, and should be avoided.
  </aside>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Declarative Configuration</strong></p>
<p>This is an extension of immutability but for the configuration. It
basically means that you have a file where you defined the ideal state of
your system. The idea of storing this files in source control is often
called ‚Äúinfrastructure as code‚Äù.</p>
<p>The combination of declarative state stored in a version control system and
the ability of k8s to make it  match the state makes rollback super easy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Self-Healing Systems</strong></p>
<p>K8s will continuously take action to make sure the state on the declarative
configuration is met. Say it has declared 3 replicas, then if you go and
create one extra, it will kill it, and if you were to destroy one, it would
create it.</p>
<p>This means that k8s will not only init your system but will guard it
against any failures that might destabilize it.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="scaling-your-service-and-your-teams"><a class="header" href="#scaling-your-service-and-your-teams">Scaling Your Service and Your Teams</a></h2>
<p>K8s is great for scaling because of its decoupled architecture.</p>
<h3 id="decoupling"><a class="header" href="#decoupling">Decoupling</a></h3>
<p>In a decoupled architecture each components is separated from each other by
defined APIs and service loads</p>
<p>This basically means that we can isolate each service.</p>
<ul>
<li>The API provide a buffer between implementer and consumer.</li>
<li>Load balancing provide a buffer between running instances of each service.</li>
</ul>
<p>When we decouple the services, it makes it easier to scale, since each small
team can focus on a single <em>microservice</em></p>
<h3 id="scaling-for-applications-and-clusters"><a class="header" href="#scaling-for-applications-and-clusters">Scaling for Applications and Clusters</a></h3>
<p>Since your app is deployed in containers, which are immutable, and th
configuration o  is also declarative, scaling simply becomes a matter of
changing a number in a configuration file. Or you can even tell k8s to do that
for you.</p>
<p>Of course k8s will be limited to the resources you have, it will not create a
physical computer on demand. But k8s makes it easier to scale the cluster
itself as well.</p>
<p>Since a set of machines in a cluster are identical and the apps are decoupled
from the specifics of the machine by containers, scaling a cluster is just a
matter of provisioning the system and joining it to a cluster.</p>
<p>K8s can also come in handy when trying to forecast costs on growth and scaling.
Basically, if you have different apps that need to scale from many teams, you
can aggregate them all in a single k8s, and try to forecast the usage of the 3
apps together.</p>
<h3 id="scaling-development-teams"><a class="header" href="#scaling-development-teams">Scaling Development Teams</a></h3>
<p>Teams are ideal when using the two-pizza team when (6 to 8 people), larger
teams tend to have issues of hierarchy, poor visibility, infighting and so on.</p>
<p>K8s can help with that, since you can have multiple small teams working on
different microservices and  aggregate them all into a single k8s cluster.</p>
<p>K8s has different abstractions that make it easier to build decoupled
microservices.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>pods</strong>: are groups of containers, can contain images developed by different
teams into a single deployable unit.</li>
<li><strong>k8s services</strong>: provide load balancing, naming and discovery to isolate the
microservices.</li>
<li><strong>namespaces</strong>: provide isolation and access control, so that each microservice
can control the degree to which other services interact with it.</li>
<li><strong>ingress</strong>: easy to use front end that can combine microservices into a single
API.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="separation-of-concerns-for-consistency-and-scaling"><a class="header" href="#separation-of-concerns-for-consistency-and-scaling">Separation of Concerns for Consistency and Scaling</a></h3>
<p>K8s leads to greater consistency for the lower levels of the infrastructure.
Basically the devs need to only worry about their app meeting the SLA (service
level agreements) while the orchestration admin only need to worry about
reaching the SLA from their side.</p>
<h2 id="abstracting-you-infrastructure"><a class="header" href="#abstracting-you-infrastructure">Abstracting You Infrastructure</a></h2>
<p>When you build your app in terms of containers and deploy it via k8s APIs, you
make moving your app between environments super easy. It is simply a question
of sending the declarative config to a new cluster.</p>
<p>K8s make building deploying and managing your app truly portable across a wide
variety of environments</p>
<h2 id="efficiency"><a class="header" href="#efficiency">Efficiency</a></h2>
<p>Efficiency is measured by the ratio of the useful work performed by a machine.</p>
<p>K8s enables efficiency in multiple ways. Since developers do not need to use a
whole machine for himself/herself, but rather one container, multiple users can
share the same baremetal. Meaning less idle CPUs.</p>
<h2 id="cloud-native-ecosystem"><a class="header" href="#cloud-native-ecosystem">Cloud Native Ecosystem</a></h2>
<p>K8s is open source and has a huge community building a thousand things on top
of it. You can check the maturity of different projects in Cloud Native
Computing Foundation. The maturities are sandbox incubating and graduated,
going from less mature to most mature.</p>
<h2 id="summary"><a class="header" href="#summary">Summary</a></h2>
<p>Fundamentally k8s was design to give developers more velocity efficiency and
agility. Now that we have seen why to use it, lets see how to use it.</p>
<h1 id="deploying-a-k8s-cluster"><a class="header" href="#deploying-a-k8s-cluster">Deploying a k8s cluster</a></h1>
<p>You can use a cloud provider, deploying on  bare-metal quite hard, other good
alternatives.</p>
<p><a href="http://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/configuration/">http://kind.sigs.k8s.io</a>
that has a really cool logo, and works on using containers for the nodes.</p>
<p>Go check the pages of cloud providers on how to deploy it there since it will
change depending on the provider.</p>
<p>One thing to bare in mind is that in order to use <code>kubectl</code> with your cluster
you need a <code>~/.kube/config</code> file, probably your cloud provider will give that
to you.</p>
<p>Also you can go to <a href="/k8s_cheatsheet.html#describe-cluster">k8s cheatsheet (describe
cluster)</a> to see the basics commands on
describing a cluster.</p>
<p>I will  just cover some of the commands here, like</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">k describe nodes &lt;node name&gt;

<p>We can see that it is linux on ARM</p>
<p>Next we can see info about the operation of the node</p>
<pre><code>Conditions:

<p>Here we can see that the node is Ready, that it has sufficient memory, it has
no disk pressure, and that is has sufficient PID.</p>
<p>Then we see info about the capacity of the system.</p>

<p>We can see that k8s tracks both <code>requests</code> and upper <code>limits</code> for resource for
each Pod. The difference is that resources requested by a pod are guaranteed to
be present in the node, while pod's limit is the max amount of given resource
that pod can consume</p>
<h2 id="cluster-components"><a class="header" href="#cluster-components">Cluster Components</a></h2>
<p>Many components that make up the k8s cluster are actually deployed using k8s
itself. All of them run in the kube-system namespace</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>k8s proxy</p>
<p>It routes network traffic to load-balanced services in the k8s cluster. It
must be present on every node in the cluster</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">% k get daemonSets --namespace=kube-system kube-proxy

<p><code>kubectl</code> is the way you talk with k8s API. Here we will go over basic
<code>kubectl</code> commands.</p>
<h2 id="namespaces"><a class="header" href="#namespaces">Namespaces</a></h2>
<p>Namespaces are like folders that hold a set of objects. They are used to
organize the cluster.</p>
<p>By default the <code>kubectl</code> command interacts with the <code>default</code> namespace, but
you can specify which you want to use by <code>-n</code> or <code>--namespace=&lt;ns&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>You can also use <code>--all-namespaces</code> flag to refer to all the ns.</p>
<h2 id="contexts"><a class="header" href="#contexts">Contexts</a></h2>
<p>If you want to change the namespaces in a more <em>permanent</em> way, you can use
contexts. These get recorded in your <code>~/.kube/config</code> file. (That file also
stores how to find and auth to your cluster)</p>
<p>You can create a with a different default namespaces using</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">% kubectl config set-context my-context --namespace=mystuff
</code></pre>
<p>We need to tell <code>kubectl</code> to start using it.</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">% kubectl config use-context my-context
</code></pre>
<p>You can also use context to manage different clusters users for auth using
<code>--users</code> or <code>--cluster</code> flags with <code>set-context</code> read the man for more info</p>
<h2 id="viewing-k8s-api-objects"><a class="header" href="#viewing-k8s-api-objects">Viewing k8s API Objects</a></h2>
<p>Basically k8s is an API and kubectl is just an http client. To see the k8s
objects (everything represented by a RESTful resource) we use <code>k get &lt;resource name&gt;</code></p>
<p>By default it will throw to the STDOUT human readable stuff, but you can also
use <code>-o json</code> or <code>-o yaml</code> in case you want it in specific format.</p>
<p>Also when using <code>awk</code> you may want to use <code>--no-haders</code>.</p>
<p>You can also get multiple objects</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">k get pods,services
</code></pre>
<p>To get more info on a particular object</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">k describe &lt;resource name&gt; &lt;obj name&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>If you want to  see like a mini man page of an specific k8s object:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">% k explain pods
KIND:       Pod
VERSION:    v1

DESCRIPTION:
    Pod is a collection of containers that can run on a host. This resource is
    created by clients and scheduled onto hosts.

FIELDS:
  apiVersion	&lt;string&gt;
    APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an object.
    Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal value, and
    may reject unrecognized values. More info:

</code></pre>
<p>Sometimes you want to continually observe the state of a k8s resource, like
when waiting for an app to restart of something you can use the <code>--watch</code> flag:</p>
<pre><code>k get pods -n kube-system --watch
</code></pre>
<h2 id="creating-updating-and-destroying-k8s-objects"><a class="header" href="#creating-updating-and-destroying-k8s-objects">Creating, updating and destroying k8s objects</a></h2>
<p>Objects in the k8s API are represented as JSON or YAML files. We can query the
server for those, or post them with an API request.</p>
<p>You use these JSON and YAML files to create, update or delete objects in your
k8s server.</p>
<p><strong>Create</strong> an object from <code>obj.yaml</code> file.</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">% k apply -f obj.yaml
</code></pre>
<p>The yaml file will have the resource type of the object.</p>
<p>You can use the same command to <strong>update</strong> an object</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">% k apply -f obj.yaml
</code></pre>
<p>If nothing change it will not do anything, it will exit successfully, good for
<code>for</code> loops. You can do <code>--dry-run</code> to print objects to the terminal without
actually sending them.</p>
<p>To do interactive edits you can use</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">% k edit &lt;resource-name&gt; &lt;obj-name&gt;
# example k edit pod coredns-76f75df574-k97nj  -n kube-system
</code></pre>
<p>It will open the <code>yaml</code> in a text editor, wonce you save it will automatically
be uploaded back to the k8s cluster.</p>
<p>The <code>apply</code> command also has a history of the previous configurations
<code>edit-last-applied</code>, <code>set-last-applied</code> and <code>view-last-applied</code> for example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">% k apply -f myobj.yaml view-last-applied
</code></pre>
<p>To delete you can simply run</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">% k delete -f myobj.yaml
</code></pre>
<p>You can also delete an object without the file using</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">% k delete &lt;resource-name&gt; &lt;obj-name&gt;
</code></pre>
<h2 id="labeling-and-annotating-objects"><a class="header" href="#labeling-and-annotating-objects">Labeling and Annotating Objects</a></h2>
<p>You can update the labels and annotations using <code>label</code> and <code>annotate</code> (who
would have thought).</p>
<p>For example to add the <code>color=red</code> label to the pod named <code>bar</code> you can run:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">k label pods bar color=red
</code></pre>
<p>You can not rewrite unless using <code>--overwrite</code> flag.</p>
<p>Finally you can remove a label by doing</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">k labels pods bar color-
</code></pre>
<h2 id="debugging-commands"><a class="header" href="#debugging-commands">Debugging Commands</a></h2>
<p>You can check logs from a pod by:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">k logs &lt;pod-name&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>If you have multiple container in your pods you can choose which container to
view using the <code>-c</code> flag.</p>
<p>If you want to follow add <code>-f</code>.</p>
<p>You can also use the <code>exec</code> command to execute a command in a running
container.</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">k exec -it &lt;pod-name&gt; -- bash
</code></pre>
<p>If you do not have bash or a shell in your container, you can <code>attach</code> to a
running process</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">k attach -it &lt;pod-name&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>You can also copy files to and from a container using <code>cp</code></p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">k cp &lt;pod-name&gt;:/path/to/remote/file /path/to/local/file
</code></pre>
<p>This will copy a file from the container to your local machine.</p>
<p>You can also forward traffic from your local system to the pod</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">k port-forward &lt;pod name&gt; 8080:80
</code></pre>
<p>Forwards traffic from the local machine on port 8080 to the remote container on
port 80</p>
<p>If you want to see the last 10 events in a namespace</p>
<pre><code>k get events
</code></pre>
<p>You can also stream events <code>--watch</code></p>
<p>Finally,  to check cluster resources being used</p>
<pre><code>k top nodes
</code></pre>
<p>or</p>
<pre><code>k top pods
</code></pre>
<p>These commands will only work if metrics servers are present, which they likely
are.</p>
<h2 id="cluster-management"><a class="header" href="#cluster-management">Cluster Management</a></h2>
<p>Cordon and drain a particular node:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>cordon</em>: prevent future pods form being scheduled onto that machine</li>
<li><em>drain</em>: remove any pods that are currently running on that machine.</li>
</ul>
<p>Useful for removing physical machine for repairs or upgrades. You would do <code>k cordon</code> and then <code>k drain</code> to safely remove the machine form the cluster.</p>
<p>Once the system is back online do <code>k uncordon</code> there is no <code>undrain</code> it will
naturally get back to normal.</p>
<h1 id="pods"><a class="header" href="#pods">Pods</a></h1>
<p>K8s groups multiple containers into a single atomic unit called a <em>pod</em> (This
also goes with the docker theme, since a group of whales is a pod lol)</p>
<p>A pod is a collection of app containers and volumes running in the same
environment. Containers in a pod always land in the same machine.</p>
<p>Apps running in the same pod share, ip addresses and port, hostname, and can
communicate to each other using interprocess communication channels. Meaning
they share:</p>
<ul>
<li>network namespace</li>
<li>UTS namespace</li>
<li>IPC namespace</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="thinking-in-pods"><a class="header" href="#thinking-in-pods">Thinking in Pods</a></h2>
<p><em>What should go in a Pod?</em> To answer this question you go look at your
different containers and ask <em>"Will these containers work correctly if they
land on different machines?"</em> If no, then a pod is the correct way of grouping
them. If yes, you can use multiple pods.</p>
<p>An example, say you want to deploy a wordpress app with a mysql database. Would
you put them in the same pod? I already read the book so I know the answer is
no, but why?</p>
<p>The answer is no because both of those services do not need to scale together.
The wordpress app itself is stateless, so you can create more wordpress pods if
you are scaling. On the other hand a mysql database is much different to scale,
it can be trickier, and you are likely to increase the resources dedicated to a
single mysql pod.</p>
<h2 id="the-pod-manifest"><a class="header" href="#the-pod-manifest">The Pod Manifest</a></h2>
<p>Pods are describe in a <em>manifest</em> which is a text-file representation of the
k8s API object.</p>
<p>As you might remember from the fist chapter, k8s uses a <em>declarative
configuration</em>, which basically means that you tell k8s your ideal state of the
world and it will take action to ensure the state becomes a reality.</p>
<p>When you send a manifest to k8s, it will accept it and process it before
storing it in persistent storage <code>(etcd)</code>. The <em>scheduler</em> will find pods that
have not been assigned to a node, and will place the pods onto those nodes
depending on the resources and constrains you specified in your manifest. K8s
will try to ensure pods from the same app are in different machines for
reliability.</p>
<p>You can see the pods with</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">k get pods
</code></pre>
<p>You can delete a pod with</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">k delete pods/&lt;name&gt;
</code></pre>
<h3 id="creating-a-manifest"><a class="header" href="#creating-a-manifest">Creating a manifest</a></h3>
<p>Pod manifest should be treated in the same way a source code, adding comments
to help explain the pod to new team members and stuff like that.</p>
<p>The manifests include a couple of key fields and attributes,</p>
<ul>
<li><code>metadata</code>:
<ul>
<li><code>name</code>: a unique identifier for the deployment</li>
<li><code>namespace</code>: the Kubernetes namespace where the deployment will live</li>
<li><code>labels</code>: key-value pairs that can be used to filter and categorize objects</li>

<li><code>containers</code>:
<ul>
<li><code>name</code>: a unique identifier for the container</li>
<li><code>image</code>: the Docker image to use for this container</li>
<li><code>command</code>: the default command to run in the container</li>
<li><code>args</code>: any additional arguments to pass to the command</li>
<li><code>volumeMounts</code>: mounts for persistent storage or other files</li>

<h2 id="health-checks"><a class="header" href="#health-checks">Health Checks</a></h2>
<p>When you are running an app in k8s, it is automatically kept alive by a process
health check. This ensure that the app is always running, if it is not it k8s
will restart it.</p>
<p>Sometimes, checking if the process is alive is not enough, maybe it was left
hanging or something like that. K8s has something to check application
<em>liveness</em> and other stuff for your app.</p>
<p>There are different kinds of probes here are some:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Liveness Probe</strong>
This will check app specific stuff, for example checking if http is
returning 200.</p>
<p>While the default response to a failed liveness is to restart you can
change what happened with <code>restartPolicy</code></p>
<p>Here is an example of a <code>livenessProbe</code></p>

<h2 id="resource-management"><a class="header" href="#resource-management">Resource Management</a></h2>
<p>K8s allow you to increase the overall utilization of the machines that are in
the cluster.</p>
<p>Utilization is defined as the amount of resource actively being used divided by
the amount of a resource that has been purchased</p>
<p>Example, if you purchase a one-core machine, and your app uses one tenth of a
core, then your utilization is 10%</p>
<p>You can tell k8s the upper limit and lower limit of resources you want for an
specific container. Keep in mind that this is on a per-container basis, the
whole pod will the sum of the containers.</p>
<p>You can do this by setting up <code>resources</code> in the manifest. The lower limit is
<code>requests</code> and the upper limit is <code>limits</code>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-yaml">spec:
    containers:
    - image: blabla:latest
      name: jose
      resouces:
        cpu: "500m"
        memory: "128Mi"
      limit:
        cpu: "1000m"
        memory: "256Mi"
    # more stuff

<h2 id="persisting-data-with-volumes"><a class="header" href="#persisting-data-with-volumes">Persisting Data with Volumes</a></h2>
<p>When a container restarts, any data in it will also be deleted. Which is good
since we do not want to leave around cruft.</p>
<p>We can still add volumes to our pods though, that will persist this deletion</p>
<p>In order to do this, you need to two things to the manifest <code>spec.volumes</code>,
which is an array of all volumes that the pod will need.</p>
<p>And the other is <code>volumeMount</code> which specify inside the container definition
the file system to use.</p>
<p>So basically one is like, what volumes will the whole pod use, and the other is
specific to each container.</p>
<pre><code class="language-yaml">spec:

<h1 id="introduction-1"><a class="header" href="#introduction-1">Introduction</a></h1>
<p>Helm is the package manager for k8s. Let us do a super quick dive into what k8s
is an all that just to give the context necessary to understand helm.</p>
<h2 id="context-for-helm-containers--k8s"><a class="header" href="#context-for-helm-containers--k8s">Context for Helm (containers &amp; k8s)</a></h2>
<p>Sometime ago someone thought of a new way of making apps, instead of them being
a big monolithic service, we could split everything into small discrete
standalone services. Then we could join those services using API over the
network and build the application that way. That is how microservices were
born.</p>
<h3 id="containers"><a class="header" href="#containers">Containers</a></h3>
<p>To help with this the concept of containers was introduced, it is different of
a VM because the VM runs an entire OS on on a host machine. On the other hand,
a container has its own file system, but it uses the same OS kernel as the
host.</p>
<p>A container is a program together with its dependencies and environment, they
are packaged together into a <em>container image</em> which can be build based on a
file where you specify the packages you want to run, and how to set the
environments. The cool part is that all those instructions are not compiled
into a binary or anything, but they are packaged into discrete layers.</p>
<p>So if a host has an image with five layers, and there is another host that
needs the same image, it will just fetch the layers it does not already have.</p>
<p>Say you have three images using <code>fedora-minimal:37</code>, well it would reuse that
layer on all those three.</p>
<p>Those images are stored in a <em>registry</em>, the registry tells hosts which layers
compose an image. So the host can only download the layers it need from the
registry.</p>
<p>A registry identifies an image by three things:</p>
<ul>
<li>name: basically a string <code>fedora</code> or <code>fedora-minimal</code></li>
<li>tag: usually the version <code>latest</code> or <code>v1</code></li>
<li>digest: a hash of the image, since the tags are mutable.</li>
</ul>
<p>They look like <code>name:tag@digest</code>.</p>
<h3 id="kubernetes-or-k8s-like-the-cool-kids-call-it"><a class="header" href="#kubernetes-or-k8s-like-the-cool-kids-call-it">Kubernetes (or k8s like the cool kids call it)</a></h3>
<p>So with all these container stuff, some questions begin to arise:</p>
<ul>
<li>How do we best execute lots of containers?</li>
<li>How can they work together?</li>
<li>How do we manage memory, cpu, network and storage?</li>
</ul>
<p>Well a bunch of companies tried to create this orchestration of containers
technology to answer those questions, at the end as per 2024 seems like Google
won, and we now all use ‚õµÔ∏è K8s.(which is greek for ship's capitan or something
like that)</p>
<p>K8s won because it introduced two concepts that people really liked.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Declarative infrastructure</strong>
Basically you tell k8s what your desired state of the cluster is, and it
will work to make that happen.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Reconciliation loop</strong>
How does k8s work behinds the scenes to reach the declarative configuration
we set? Using a reconciliation loop.</p>
<p>In a reconciliation loop, the scheduler says: "Here is what the user wrote
as his/her desired state. Here is the current state. They are not the same,
lets reconcile them."</p>
<p>Say you specified storage, and the scheduler sees that we do not have
storage yet, it will create units of storage and attach them to your
containers.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="pods-1"><a class="header" href="#pods-1">Pods</a></h3>
<p>We do not deal directly with containers when setting up our k8s cluster.
We use a pods. A pod which is basically a group of containers. These are
defined in a manifest (<code>yaml</code> or <code>json</code>, but most people use <code>yaml</code>)</p>
<pre><code class="language-yaml">apiVersion: v1 # we can see that this will be a v1 Pod
kind: Pod
metadata:
    name: example-pod
spec:
    containers:
    - image: "fedora-minimal:latest"
    - name: example-fedora
</code></pre>
<p>A Pod can have 1 or more containers. The containers that help preconfigurate
stuff for the main one, are called <em>init containers</em>.</p>
<p>The ones that run alongside the main container are called <em>sidecar containers</em></p>
<h3 id="configmaps"><a class="header" href="#configmaps"><code>ConfigMaps</code></a></h3>
<p>Basically in a pod you describe the configuration the containers need, like
network ports files system mount points. You can store configuration
information for k8s in <code>ConfigMaps</code> and password and stuff like that in
<code>Secret</code>.</p>
<p>Here is an example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-yaml">apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
    name: configuration-data
data: # inside here we will declare aribitrary key/value stuff
    backgroundColor: blue
    title: Learning Helm
</code></pre>
<p>For <code>Secret</code> is pretty much the same as for <code>ConfigMaps</code> but the values in data
must be Base64 encoded.</p>
<p>Pods then can be linked to the ConfigMaps like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-yaml">apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
    name: example-pod
spec:
    volumes:
    # note that this is not the metadata name you used in the ConfigMap
    - name: my-configuration
      configMap:
        name: configuration-data # same name as in metadata of ConfigMap
    containers:
    - image: "fedora-minimal:latest"
      name: example-fedora
      env:
        - name: TITLE # the env variable will be title
          valueFrom:
            configMapKeyRef:
                name: configuration-data # name for the volume
                key: title # key in the actual ConfigMap
</code></pre>
<h3 id="deployments"><a class="header" href="#deployments">Deployments</a></h3>
<p>Pretty cool stuff, but we might not just one to run one instance of our
container, therefore we can use something called <code>Deployments</code>.</p>
<p>A <code>Deployment</code> describe an application as a collection of identical pods,we can
tell k8s to create our app with a single pod and scale it up to five pods.</p>
<pre><code class="language-yaml">apiVersion: apps/v1 # apps/v1 Deployment
kind: Deployment
metadata:
    name: example-deployment
    labels:
        app: my-deployment
spec:
    replicas: 3 # we want three replicas of the following template
    selector:
        matchLabels:
            app: my-deployment
    template:
        metadata:
            labels:
                app: my-deployment
        spec:
           containers :
            -image: "fedora-minimal"
             name: "example-fedora"
</code></pre>
<h3 id="service"><a class="header" href="#service">Service</a></h3>
<p>A <code>Service</code> is a persistent network resource, that persists even if the pod or
pods attached to it go away.</p>
<pre><code class="language-yaml">apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
    name: example-service
spec:
    selector:
      app: my-deployment
    ports:
      -  protocol: TCP
         port: 80
         targetPort: 8080
</code></pre>
<p>Here we define a service for the pods with the <code>app: my-deployment</code>, telling
that traffic port 80 of this <code>Service</code> will be routed to 8080.</p>
<h2 id="helms-goal"><a class="header" href="#helms-goal">Helm's Goal</a></h2>
<p>So we have seen the building block of K8s, say you want to deploy a WordPress
app, you would need a <code>Deployment</code> for the containers, then a <code>ConfigMap</code> and
<code>Secret</code> for the password, maybe some <code>Service</code> objects and so on. That sounds
like a lot of <code>yaml</code>.</p>
<p>The core idea of Helm  is that all those objects can be packaged to be
<code>installed</code>, <code>updated</code> and <code>deleted</code> together.</p>
<p>Basically helm is the package manger of kuberentes.  Helm will allow you to
spin up all the k8s objects necessary for an app by just using a few commands.</p>
<p>Here are some of the things that helm can do:</p>
<ul>
<li>Provide package repos (similar to <code>dnf</code> or <code>apt</code>).</li>
<li>Familiar install, upgrade, delete commands.</li>
<li>Helm has a method for configuring the packages before installing them.</li>
<li>Helm can also let you know what already is installed.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can also limit the installation of packages to a specific namespace, so you
can install the same package in different namespaces in the same k8s cluster.
(<a href="/k8s_up_and_running.html#namespaces">What is a namespace?</a>)</p>
<p>Helm also provides <strong>reusability</strong>, it uses charts for this. A chart provides a
pattern for producing the same k8s manifests. But the cool part is that you can
also add more configuration to those charts.</p>
<p>Helm provides patterns for storing the initial configuration plus the changes
you did. Helm encourages k8s users to package their <code>yaml</code> into charts so that
these descriptors can be reused.</p>
<p>One last thing, keep in mind that helm is not a configuration tool, it helps
but it there are software specialized on that like ansible, puppet or chef.</p>
<h2 id="helm-architecture"><a class="header" href="#helm-architecture">Helm Architecture</a></h2>
<p>Here are the main components that helm uses.</p>
<h3 id="k8s-resourceobject"><a class="header" href="#k8s-resourceobject">K8s Resource/Object</a></h3>
<p>These are the <code>Pods</code>, <code>ConfigMap</code>, <code>Deployment</code>, we have seen throughout the
chapter. K8s has a lot of these objects, you can even define custom ones using
custom resource definition (CRD).</p>
<p>All the resources share some elements</p>
<pre><code class="language-yaml">apiVersion: apps/v1 # api and version of the resource
kind: Deployment # resource type
metadata: # top-level data on the resource/object
    name: example-deployment # req for all objects
    labels: # used for creating query-able handles
        some-name: some-value
    annotations: # authors to attach their own keys and values
        some-name: some-value
</code></pre>
<h3 id="charts"><a class="header" href="#charts">Charts</a></h3>
<p>A package is called a chart. The idea es that k8s meaning captian, helm being
the steering mechanism of the ship. The chart plots the way k8s apps should be
installed.</p>
<p>A Chart is a set of files and directories that describe how to install the
different k8s resource/objects</p>
<p>A chart contains</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Chart.yaml</code>: describes the chart (name, description, authors)</li>
<li><code>templates</code> directory: Inside all the k8s manifests  potentially annotated
with templating directives</li>
<li><code>values.yaml</code>  file that provides the default configuration. You can override
during installation.</li>
</ul>
<p>These are the basic stuff for an unpacked chart, a packed chart is just a tar
ball with all this inside.</p>
<h3 id="resources-installations-and-releases"><a class="header" href="#resources-installations-and-releases">Resources, Installations and Releases</a></h3>
<p>When a helm chart is installed:</p>
<ol>
<li>helm reads the charts (will download if necessary)</li>
<li>It sends the values into the templates generating the k8s manifests</li>
<li>The manifests are sent to k8s</li>
<li>K8s creates the requested resources inside the cluster</li>
</ol>
<p>One last concept <em>release</em>. A release is created each time we use helm to
modify the installation</p>
<h1 id="using-helm"><a class="header" href="#using-helm">Using Helm</a></h1>
<p>Helm is a cli, you can install it with your favorite package manger or  build
it from source it is written in golang.</p>
<p>You can check the version by</p>
<pre><code>helm version
</code></pre>
<p>Helm will use the same KUBECONFIG file you have configured for <code>kubectl</code>, it
will look in the same places, though you can specify a path for one.</p>
<p>The most common workflow is:</p>
<ol>
<li>Add a chart repo</li>
<li>Find a chart to install</li>
<li>Install a Helm  chart</li>
<li>See the list of what is installed</li>
<li>Upgrade your installation</li>
<li>Delete your installation</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="adding-a-chart-repo"><a class="header" href="#adding-a-chart-repo">Adding a Chart Repo</a></h2>
<p>A Helm Chart is an individual package that can be installed into your k8s
cluster. You can find then  at chart repositories.</p>
<p>You can find popular repositories in <a href="https://artifacthub.io">the artifact hub</a></p>
<p>By default <code>helm</code> does not have any repo added, so you need to look for one
there.</p>
<p>Bitnamis's official Helm charts are one of the best well-curated charts repos.
(Some Bitnami devs are among the core contributors who design the helm repo
system)</p>
<p>To add a repo you do <code>helm repo add</code> so:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">% helm repo add bitnami https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami
"bitnami" has been added to your repositories
</code></pre>
<p>Now if you do</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">% helm repo list
NAME    URL
bitnami https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami
</code></pre>
<p>You will see it there. After that we can look for specific charts.</p>

</code></pre>
<p>Typical stuff, just a few things to keep in mind.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Difference between an installation and a chart.</p>
<p>An installation of a chart is a specific instance of the chart
One chart may have many installations</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can repeat instance names (<code>mysite</code>), but it must be on different
namespaces.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You can set values specific to your installation, you can set them directly
from the command line with <code>--set</code>  for example. (this works with both set
<code>install</code> and <code>upgrade</code>)</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">% helm install mysite bitnami/drupal --set drupalUsername=admin
</code></pre>
<p>You can also have them in a <code>yaml</code> file, which is the recommended approach.</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">% helm upgrade mysite bitnami/drupal --values values.yaml
</code></pre>
<p>For example <code>values.yaml</code> would look like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-yaml">drupalUsername: admin
drupalEmail: admin@example.com

<p>Not much to say here, does what expected.</p>
<h2 id="upgrading-an-installation"><a class="header" href="#upgrading-an-installation">Upgrading an Installation</a></h2>
<p>So there are two types of changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>upgrade version of the chart</li>
<li>upgrade configuration of the chart</li>
</ul>
<p>Every time we perform an upgrade we are doing a new release of the same
installation.</p>
<p>Helm will attempt to to alter only the bare minimum, so if you only changes one
simple configuration variable, it will not like restart everything and all
that.</p>
<p>To restart stuff just use <code>kubectl</code>.</p>
<p>To update your chart with a new version you can</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">% helm repo update
% helm upgrade mysite bitnami/drupal
</code></pre>
<h2 id="configuration-values"><a class="header" href="#configuration-values">Configuration Values</a></h2>
<p>If you do this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">% helm install mysite bitnami/drupal --values values.yaml
% helm upgrade mysite bitnami/drupal
</code></pre>
<p>Chances are you lost your values, so it is good to always send the <code>yaml</code></p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">% helm install mysite bitnami/drupal --values values.yaml
% helm upgrade mysite bitnami/drupal --values values.yaml
</code></pre>
<p>You can use <code>helm get values mysite</code> to see the values sent on the last install
or upgrade.</p>
<p>You could also use:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">% helm upgrade mysite bitnami/drupal --reuse-values
</code></pre>
<p>But it is not recommended</p>
<h2 id="uninstalling-charts"><a class="header" href="#uninstalling-charts">Uninstalling charts</a></h2>
<p>Not much to say here</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">% helm uninstall mysite
</code></pre>
<p>Works as you would expect, if you would do</p>
<pre><code>% helm list
</code></pre>
<p>You will not see it there.</p>
<p>Lastly, you can see a special record that contain release information.</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">% k get secret
</code></pre>
<p>Helm stores there the info.</p>
<p>If you uninstall you loose the history, so be careful. You could <code>helm uninstall --keep-history</code>. Good if you plan on doing <code>helm rollback</code>.</p>
<p>That is pretty much the basics on helm.</p>

<p>ELK is great for <strong>Centralized Logging</strong>, this enable us to not waste time
trying to find where the issues are, we have all in one place. We also can</p>
<p>Kibana is the visualization of the ELK stack, you can visualize the data on
real time.</p>
<h1 id="components"><a class="header" href="#components">Components</a></h1>
<p>It has several open source add-ons, but the main ones are these:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Beats</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Light weight way of getting data into the ELK stack.</li>
<li>Single purpose tools.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Logstash</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Transform data as it comes into structured data that will be stored.</li>
<li>Very resource intensive</li>
<li>Example: is like cutting carrots ü•ï as you get from the store and saving
them to the fridge, instead of cutting them until you are about to cook</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Elasticsearch</strong>:
<ul>
<li>The part of the stack that stores the data itself</li>
<li>Usually deployed by a cluster, it has redundant copies so it can work if
something fails</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Kibana</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Web front end for the ELK stack</li>
<li>Quick bird‚Äôs eye view across your infra</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="logstash"><a class="header" href="#logstash">Logstash</a></h1>
<p>Three block  of code in config</p>
<ul>
<li>Input: get data in</li>
<li>Output put data somewhere, usually elasticsearch</li>
<li>Filter block: where data is transformed and relocated, where we can parse
lines.</li>
</ul>
<p>Example of config file.</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">input { stdin {} }

filter {
	mutate {
		add_field =&gt; { "greeting" =&gt; "Hello %{message}" }
	}
}

output { stdout {} }
</code></pre>
<p>This will take input from <code>STDIN</code> and output it to <code>STDOUT</code>, anything we type would be returned in a structured format with a <code>greeting</code> field.</p>
<h2 id="logstash-plugins"><a class="header" href="#logstash-plugins">Logstash Plugins</a></h2>
<p>It has more than 100 packages installed with logstash</p>
<p><code>/usr/share/logstash/bin/logstash-plugins list</code> for listing them</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Beats: Input plugin to work with <code>beats</code></p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">input { beats { port =&gt; 5044 } }
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>File:</p>
<ul>
<li>Get input from a file, or multiple, you can use wildcards</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="language-bash">input { file { path=&gt; "/var/log/kern.log" } }
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>elasticsearch</p>
<ul>
<li>this is an <strong>output</strong> plugin, you can point to multiple servers</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="language-bash">output { elasticsearch { host =&gt; ["localhost:9200"] } }
</code></pre>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="filters"><a class="header" href="#filters">Filters</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Grok</p>
<ul>
<li>convert unstructured data to structured data</li>
<li>based on regex, but it has many abstractions in case you want to use them</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="language-bash">filter {
	grok {
		match =&gt; {
			"message" =&gt; "%{IP:client} %{WORD:method} %{URIPATHPARAM}:request...."
		}
	}
}
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mutate</p>
<ul>
<li>let you transform the data</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="language-bash">filter {
	grok {
		match =&gt; {
			"message" =&gt; "%{TIMESTAMP:t} new users: %{GREEDYDATA:users}"
			# 2024-01-23 new users: jose,pedro,maria
		}
	}

	mutate {
		split =&gt; {"users" =&gt; ","}
	}
}
</code></pre>
<p>In this example <em>grok</em> will get the time stamp of the message and will get all the string after <code>new users:</code> then we use <em>mutate</em> to split the users and have it stored as a list so when the data shows up in elasticsearch it looks like an array</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="grokconstructor"><a class="header" href="#grokconstructor">GrokConstructor</a></h2>
<p><a href="http://grokconstructor.appspot.com">grokconstructor.appspot.com</a> Helper for creating grok filters.</p>
<p>You can see also some <strong>grok patterns</strong> too.</p>
<p>Basically you can paste the logs there build your filter from there</p>
<p><img src="img/grok.png" alt="grok.png" /></p>
<h1 id="beats"><a class="header" href="#beats">Beats</a></h1>
<p>Why use beats? Logstash is overkill for a lot of things people use it for.</p>
<p>It uses JRuby (basically ruby that runs on the JVM), and by default it is
configured to set aside 1GiB of memory for the JVM. That is too much to just
send things to Elastic</p>
<p><strong>Beats</strong> (written in Go) is way more ü™Ω<strong>lightweight</strong>, it has been design to be. Becuase of this can be run everywhere.</p>
<p>There are several beats</p>
<ul>
<li>Heartbeat (Uptime)</li>
<li>Filebeat (Logs and text data)</li>
<li>Metricbeat (Metrics)</li>
<li>Packetbeat (Network data)</li>
<li>Winlogbeat (Windows events logs)</li>
<li>Auditbeat (audit logs and data)</li>
<li>Functionbeat (serverless data)</li>
</ul>
<aside>
üí° Note on Heartbeat (on opposed to other beats) run centrally and monitors
servers, instead of the other way around.
