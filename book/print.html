<blockquote>
<p>Site <strong>Reliability</strong> Engineering is an engineering discipline devoted to
helpings orgs <strong>sustainably</strong> achieve the <strong>appropriate</strong> level of
reliability in their systems, services and products.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>3 key words from definition</p>
<ul>
<li>Reliability: even  if you have the best software in the world, and the best
sales team, if the sw is not up when customers need it, you lose a lot of:
<ul>
<li>Revenue</li>
<li>Time</li>
<li>Reputation</li>
<li>Health</li>
<li>Hiring</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Appropriate
<ul>
<li>Usually 100% reliable is not achievable, it is likely that your
dependencies are not 100% reliable.</li>
<li>You need to use <em><strong>service level indicators/service level objectives</strong></em>
(SLI/SLO) to help determine an appropriate level of reliability.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Sustainable
<ul>
<li>If the people in the org are burned out they wont be able to build
reliable systems.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="sre-vs-devops"><a class="header" href="#sre-vs-devops">SRE vs Devops</a></h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>SRE implements class devops</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>SRE is to reliability as devops is to delivery</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It‚Äôs all about the direction</p>
<p><img src="img/sre-vs-devops.png" alt="sre-vs-devops.png" /> <em><a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/becoming-sre/9781492090540/">Source: Becoming SRE
O'Reilly</a></em></p>
</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Devops go from development to production operations</li>
<li>SRE seems to start on prod operations, and going back to improve the result.</li>
</ul>
<p>Basically these two phrases:</p>
<ul>
<li>Devops thinks, how can I deploy this from my laptop to production</li>
<li>SRE starts at production, how can I make the environment more reliable.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="sre-mindset"><a class="header" href="#sre-mindset">SRE Mindset</a></h2>
<p>It is born out of curiosity: <em>How does a system work? How does it fail?</em></p>
<p>Zoom out and Zoom in as much as possible, how does the‚Ä¶ work</p>
<ul>
<li>The whole app, development and deployment process</li>
<li>The entire service</li>
<li>The infrastructure</li>
<li>The physical overlay of the infra</li>
<li>The sociotechnical  context in which the infra runs</li>
<li>The org context where the sociotechnical context resides in</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="keeping-focus-on-the-customer"><a class="header" href="#keeping-focus-on-the-customer">Keeping Focus on the Customer</a></h3>
<p>Small example, say you have a 100 servers running a front end pool, suddenly 14
systems fail and are not recovering.  This situation is:</p>
<ol>
<li>No big deal; you can deal with it at your leisure</li>
<li>Something that warrants your immediate attentions. Stop what you are doing
and focus on this</li>
<li>Crisis, even if 2 AM go wake the CEO</li>
</ol>
<p>The answer, <em>it depends</em>, you need to ask, how does this affect the system as a
whole. If the customers wont see anything diff then <strong>a.</strong> If visible by
customers then <strong>b</strong>. If the service is dead in the water and this means no
revenue, go wake the CEO.</p>
<p>So basically you need to ask: <em>What is the intention of the system from the
customer‚Äôs perspective?</em></p>
<h3 id="sres-relationship-with-failure"><a class="header" href="#sres-relationship-with-failure">SRE‚Äôs Relationship with Failure</a></h3>
<p>SRE are very collaborative. Reliability is a collaborative endeavour by nature.</p>
<p>The SRE mindset views errors as an opportunity to learn. Learning from failure
is a core component of an SRE.</p>
<p>SRE treats errors as a signal and we like clear signals. With an SRE mindset
errors can serve the helping understand the system better. This means we need
to surface the errors in addition to eliminate them.</p>
<p>SRE feels ownership of the whole service, t<strong>hey do not say often ‚Äúnot my code,
not my problem‚Äù.</strong> This can be un <em>arma de doble filo.</em> Because of the <strong>yak
shaving issue,</strong> where you go to do one task, say update a package, but then
you check and for the new package you need to upgrade the OS, but to upgrade
the OS you need to‚Ä¶ and you end up with a trimmer in your hands and a yak
infront of you. Taking ownership of the whole range of services and so on, can
lead to this. **</p>
<h3 id="the-mindset-in-motion"><a class="header" href="#the-mindset-in-motion">The Mindset in Motion</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>How does a system work? ‚Üí How will the system work if we scale it?</li>
<li>How does a system work? ‚Üí How can the system work with less operational load
<ul>
<li>SREs are angered by <strong>toil</strong> and the almost allergic reaction it provokes
in them.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>How does a system work? ‚Üí How can the system work reliable for more people</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="culture"><a class="header" href="#culture">Culture</a></h2>
<p>Support an enviorment where SREs can thrive.</p>
<ul>
<li>Celebrate the elimination of toil, give SREs opportunity to look for toil and
come up with ideas on how to remove it.</li>
<li>Support curosity</li>
</ul>
<p>Other good way is to support the creation of documentation ‚Äúit is not finished
until it is documented‚Äù</p>
<h3 id="new-hires"><a class="header" href="#new-hires">New hires</a></h3>
<p>For new hires good some good tasks are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Find something unclear, missing or in some way needing improvment on the docs
and fix it.
<ul>
<li>This has the benefit that they need to interact with the docs and read
it, at a deep enough level that they can improve it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Taking our inline database of all systems on our network, and make sure it
was correct by visiting the locations</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="avoid"><a class="header" href="#avoid">Avoid</a></h3>
<p>How to avoid the incident-handling train of the SRE will always fix everything.</p>
<p>A good question to anwser is ‚ÄúWho is getting smarter and what are we doing
about it?‚Äù The ideal would be that you are getting good new info about your
systems and how they fail.</p>
<p>But if just the SREs are the ones that are learning, you are in reverse, you
are going the opposite direction of culture you are hoping to create.</p>
<p>If the answer is close to: SREs, engineering personnel and relevant stake
holders, you can go to the next question, What is the rest of the org doing
with this knowledge?.</p>
<h3 id="cool-ideas-to-improve-culture"><a class="header" href="#cool-ideas-to-improve-culture"><strong>Cool Ideas to improve culture</strong></a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Start a <strong>postmortem group</strong>,
<ul>
<li>Where someone does a writeup of an issue/outage that happened. Give it in
advance before the meeting, and discuss what could have been done diff,
or proposal on the arch, stuff like that.
<ul>
<li>Good first questions are:
<ul>
<li>What is missing from the write-up we have here?</li>
<li>What do we still not  know, or what may we never know?</li>
<li>Why wasn‚Äôt this worse?</li>
</ul>

<p>You already have a good well-exercised skill for troubleshooting and debugging.</p>
<p>Do exercises in SadServers, like leet code but for infrastructure.</p>
<p>Change you mindset from ‚Äúmonitor all the things‚Äù to ‚Äúmeasure reliability from
the customer perspective, not the component perspective‚Äù</p>
<p>Using terms like ‚Äúcontributing factors‚Äù instead of ‚Äúroot cause‚Äù can change both
your internal and external way of looking at an issue. More on this on chapter

<h3 id="what-to-ask-at-the-sre-interview"><a class="header" href="#what-to-ask-at-the-sre-interview">What to ask at the SRE Interview</a></h3>
<p>Some good conversation starters:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Tell me about your monitoring system</strong></p>
<p>This exposes all sort of info on organization, structure, collaboration,
ownership, How decision are made, and so on.</p>
<p>Some follow up questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Who owns monitoring in your org?</li>
<li>How many monitoring systems are there in active use?</li>
<li>Who (apps/services/teams) send data to those systems, and who access
them?</li>
<li>How easy it is to onboard a new app/service to your monitoring?</li>
<li>What decisions are made using the data?</li>
<li>Are there alerts generated fromt his system?</li>
<li>What makes you happy and unhappy with your current system?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Tell me about your post-incidents review process</strong></p>
<p>Here you are trying to see how intentional are they on learning from
failure</p>
<ul>
<li>Do you hold post-incidents review after your outages?</li>
<li>What is their purpose?</li>
<li>Who is ‚Äúin the room‚Äù for them?</li>
<li>How do you document your outages?</li>
<li>Can you tell me (at whatever level of details you are comfortable) about
a recent outage</li>
<li>Do you have a sense of the most common classes of outage you have seen in
the last N month? (config related, overload/resource-deprivation
failures, code bug)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Tell me about you on-call setup</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Do people get time off after incidents?</li>
<li>Who in the org participates in an on-call rotation (just SREs? Devs?
Managers?)</li>
<li>When was the last time you personally were ‚Äúpaged‚Äù?</li>
<li>Do people get paged equally often between work and off-work hours?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>What problem does SRE exist to address in your org?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>If they cannot answer that: What are some ‚Äòrecent wins‚Äô by SRE in the
past 6 to 12 months?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Can SREs check in code to major repos in your org?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>You‚Äôll see how involved is the SRE with dev work</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="a-day-in-the-life-of-an-sre"><a class="header" href="#a-day-in-the-life-of-an-sre">A Day in the Life of an SRE</a></h2>
<p>Because of the nature of the SRE role, it is hard to describe an average day,
since it most days are different to each other. So instead of an average day,
we have different modes SREs can relate to. Look at it like different hats an
SRE will wear</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Incident/Outage Mode</strong></p>
<p>There will be days were most of your time you will be involved dealing with
an accident. These days come with some feelings attached to them (fear,
anxiety, and so on), the intensity of these feelings depend on the severity
of the outage.</p>
<p>When on this mode you will be reacting not planning it is normal.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Post-incident Learning Mode</strong></p>
<p>After the incident now you have the opportunity to review the memories of
an outage and learn from it.</p>
<p>You are responsible for documenting it, in a way others can understand it.
To do this you will have to investigate a bit, look for data in your
monitoring systems, talk to your colleagues to discover what they knew and
when.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Builder/Project/Learn Mode</strong></p>
<p>This is when you actually have time to sit and...</p>
<ul>
<li>Devlop some code for services or SRE tasks</li>
<li>Provision new envs or infra</li>
<li>Improve monitoring/observability</li>
<li>Removing toil</li>
<li>Writing docs</li>
<li>Learning a new tech in anticipation of using it some day</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, there will be times when you are doing boring stuff, but that
can help you identify toil you need to remove.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Architecture Mode</strong></p>
<p>Depends on your org, but, and SRE should be showing up to design and
planning meetings where they are acting as a representative  for
reliability.</p>
<p>Be political about it, no one wants to hear, "<em>this would have never happen
if there was an SRE when this thing was designed</em>". Appeal to the sense
that everyone want to have their code in production be as reliable as
possible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Management Mode</strong></p>
<p>If the response to, <em>what did you do all day?</em>, was, <em>I went to meetings</em>,
do not worry, chances are you might be an SRE manager.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Planning Mode</strong></p>
<p>Some portion of your day will be planning.</p>
<ul>
<li>Implementation plans</li>
<li>Capacity planning</li>
<li>Self-definitional work (goals of SRE team and stuff like that)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Collaboration Mode</strong></p>
<p><mark> The SRE role is relentlessly collaborative.</mark></p>
<p>When you implement SLI/SLO (Service Level Indicators/Service Level
Objectives) you will be working with: devs, PMs, stakeholders.</p>
<p>Another example of collaborative work, is what some people call pre-launch
review. An SRE gets involved to revise the service being deployed in
production, what is necessary for it to run reliably in production</p>
<p>Do not be a gatekeeper, share this work with the devs and the stakeholders,
collaborate as much as possible</p>
<p>Finally, listen to the customers through monitoring work. The SLIs/SLOs
(Service Level Indicators, Service Level Objectives) are meant to provide
ongoing collaboration with the customer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Recovery and Self-Care Mode</strong></p>
<p>Burn out SREs are of no good to anyone. Because of the nature of SREs it
can be easy to overextending yourself. But when we hear that someone is
regularly working 60-75 hours, is not something to be proud of, that means
there is a failure in the system and needs to be fixed.</p>
<p>You need to have recovery time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>On Balance</strong></p>
<p>Balance is something good to strive for, but there are often situational
factors  that complicate the effort, for example, an <em>early service</em> vs <em>mature
service</em>, new services are always noisier and require more reactive work. They
also provide more toil to be stripped away, so maybe you expend more time in
one of these modes than in others.</p>
<p>The idea is to see this as weather patterns, I know it is going to rain hard
for some time, but I mentally prepare. Ideally things will level out. If not,
you need to strive for it. SRE attempts to be a <strong>sustainable</strong> operations
practice. If you realise this cannot be sustained maybe you need to start
looking for a different job.</p>

<aside> 
üí° K8s is an open source orchestrator for deploying containerized applications
</aside>
<p>It has become the standard API for building cloud native applications. It
provides the software needed for build and deploy, reliable, scalable
distributed systems.</p>
<p><strong>Distributed systems:</strong> Most services nowadays are delivered via the network,
they have different moving parts in different machines talking to each other
over the network via APIs.</p>
<p><strong>Reliable:</strong> Since we rely a lot on these distributed systems, they cannot
fail, even if some part of them crashes, they need to be kept up and running,
and be fault-tolerant</p>
<p><strong>Availability:</strong> They must still be available during maintenance, updates,
software rollouts and so on.</p>
<p><strong>Scalable:</strong> We live in a highly connected society, so these systems need to
be able to grow their capacity without radical redesign of the distributed
systems.</p>
<p>Most of the reasons people come to use containers and container orchestration
like k8s, can be boil down to 5 things:  <strong>velocity, scaling, abstracting your
infra, efficiency, cloud native ecosystem</strong></p>
<h2 id="development-velocity"><a class="header" href="#development-velocity">Development Velocity</a></h2>
<p>Today software is delivered via de network more quickly than ever, but velocity
is not just a matter of raw speed, people are more interested in a highly
reliable service, all users expect constant uptime, even as the software is
being updated.</p>
<p>Velocity is measures in term of the number of things you can ship while
maintaining a highly available service.</p>
<p>k8s give you the tools to to do this, the core concepts to enable this are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Immutability</strong></p>
<p>Software used to be mutable (imperative), you installed <code>vim</code> using <code>dnf</code>
and then one day you would do <code>dnf update</code>  and it would add modifications
on top of the binary that you already have for <code>vim</code>. This is what we call
<em>mutable</em> software.</p>
<p>On the other hand, <em>immutable</em> software, you would not add on top of the
previous release, you would build the image from zero. Which is how
containers work. Basically when you want to update something in a
container, you do not go inside it and do <code>dnf update vim</code> you create a new
image with the version of vim you want, destroy the old one, and create a
container with the new one.</p>
<p>This makes rollbacks way easier, and it keeps tracks of what changed from
version to version.</p>
  <aside> 
  üí° Imperatively change running containers (going into the container and
  update a package for example) is an anti-pattern, and should be avoided.
  </aside>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Declarative Configuration</strong></p>
<p>This is an extension of immutability but for the configuration. It
basically means that you have a file where you defined the ideal state of
your system. The idea of storing this files in source control is often
called ‚Äúinfrastructure as code‚Äù.</p>
<p>The combination of declarative state stored in a version control system and
the ability of k8s to make it  match the state makes rollback super easy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Self-Healing Systems</strong></p>
<p>K8s will continuously take action to make sure the state on the declarative
configuration is met. Say it has declared 3 replicas, then if you go and
create one extra, it will kill it, and if you were to destroy one, it would
create it.</p>
<p>This means that k8s will not only init your system but will guard it
against any failures that might destabilize it.</p>

<p>ELK is great for <strong>Centralized Logging</strong>, this enable us to not waste time
trying to find where the issues are, we have all in one place. We also can</p>
<p>Kibana is the visualization of the ELK stack, you can visualize the data on
real time.</p>
<h1 id="components"><a class="header" href="#components">Components</a></h1>
<p>It has several open source add-ons, but the main ones are these:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Beats</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Light weight way of getting data into the ELK stack.</li>
<li>Single purpose tools.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Logstash</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Transform data as it comes into structured data that will be stored.</li>
<li>Very resource intensive</li>
<li>Example: is like cutting carrots ü•ï as you get from the store and saving
them to the fridge, instead of cutting them until you are about to cook</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Elasticsearch</strong>:
<ul>
<li>The part of the stack that stores the data itself</li>
<li>Usually deployed by a cluster, it has redundant copies so it can work if
something fails</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Kibana</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Web front end for the ELK stack</li>
<li>Quick bird‚Äôs eye view across your infra</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="logstash"><a class="header" href="#logstash">Logstash</a></h1>
<p>Three block  of code in config</p>
<ul>
<li>Input: get data in</li>
<li>Output put data somewhere, usually elasticsearch</li>
<li>Filter block: where data is transformed and relocated, where we can parse
lines.</li>
</ul>
<p>Example of config file.</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">input { stdin {} }

filter {
	mutate {
		add_field =&gt; { "greeting" =&gt; "Hello %{message}" }
	}
}

output { stdout {} }
</code></pre>
<p>This will take input from <code>STDIN</code> and output it to <code>STDOUT</code>, anything we type would be returned in a structured format with a <code>greeting</code> field.</p>
<h2 id="logstash-plugins"><a class="header" href="#logstash-plugins">Logstash Plugins</a></h2>
<p>It has more than 100 packages installed with logstash</p>
<p><code>/usr/share/logstash/bin/logstash-plugins list</code> for listing them</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Beats: Input plugin to work with <code>beats</code></p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">input { beats { port =&gt; 5044 } }
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>File:</p>
<ul>
<li>Get input from a file, or multiple, you can use wildcards</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="language-bash">input { file { path=&gt; "/var/log/kern.log" } }
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>elasticsearch</p>
<ul>
<li>this is an <strong>output</strong> plugin, you can point to multiple servers</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="language-bash">output { elasticsearch { host =&gt; ["localhost:9200"] } }
</code></pre>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="filters"><a class="header" href="#filters">Filters</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Grok</p>
<ul>
<li>convert unstructured data to structured data</li>
<li>based on regex, but it has many abstractions in case you want to use them</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="language-bash">filter {
	grok {
		match =&gt; {
			"message" =&gt; "%{IP:client} %{WORD:method} %{URIPATHPARAM}:request...."
		}
	}
}
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mutate</p>
<ul>
<li>let you transform the data</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="language-bash">filter {
	grok {
		match =&gt; {
			"message" =&gt; "%{TIMESTAMP:t} new users: %{GREEDYDATA:users}"
			# 2024-01-23 new users: jose,pedro,maria
		}
	}

	mutate {
		split =&gt; {"users" =&gt; ","}
	}
}
</code></pre>
<p>In this example <em>grok</em> will get the time stamp of the message and will get all the string after <code>new users:</code> then we use <em>mutate</em> to split the users and have it stored as a list so when the data shows up in elasticsearch it looks like an array</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="grokconstructor"><a class="header" href="#grokconstructor">GrokConstructor</a></h2>
<p><a href="http://grokconstructor.appspot.com">grokconstructor.appspot.com</a> Helper for creating grok filters.</p>
<p>You can see also some <strong>grok patterns</strong> too.</p>
<p>Basically you can paste the logs there build your filter from there</p>
<p><img src="img/grok.png" alt="grok.png" /></p>
<h1 id="beats"><a class="header" href="#beats">Beats</a></h1>
<p>Why use beats? Logstash is overkill for a lot of things people use it for.</p>
<p>It uses JRuby (basically ruby that runs on the JVM), and by default it is
configured to set aside 1GiB of memory for the JVM. That is too much to just
send things to Elastic</p>
<p><strong>Beats</strong> (written in Go) is way more ü™Ω<strong>lightweight</strong>, it has been design to be. Becuase of this can be run everywhere.</p>
<p>There are several beats</p>
<ul>
<li>Heartbeat (Uptime)</li>
<li>Filebeat (Logs and text data)</li>
<li>Metricbeat (Metrics)</li>
<li>Packetbeat (Network data)</li>
<li>Winlogbeat (Windows events logs)</li>
<li>Auditbeat (audit logs and data)</li>
<li>Functionbeat (serverless data)</li>
</ul>
<aside>
üí° Note on Heartbeat (on opposed to other beats) run centrally and monitors
servers, instead of the other way around.
